Extern-vs-pure-Lean cross-check for `Hex.clmul`.

`Hex.clmul` carries an `@[extern "lean_hex_clmul_u64"]` attribute, so
compiled code may call into a C wrapper that dispatches to a CPU
intrinsic (`_mm_clmulepi64_si128` on x86, `vmull_p64` on aarch64) or a
portable shift-and-XOR fallback. The Lean reference implementation is
`Hex.pureClmul`. The hex-gf2 SPEC explicitly flags this extern boundary
as a divergence risk and requires that the compiled wrapper agree with
`pureClmul` on a stream of inputs.

The stream below is a deterministic 64-bit LCG (Knuth's MMIX
constants, multiplier `6364136223846793005`, increment
`1442695040888963407`) seeded from a fixed start state. Successive
draws supply `(a, b)` pairs; the cross-check passes iff every pair
satisfies `clmul a b = pureClmul a b`.

Mode: `always` (Lean-only, no oracle).
Profile: `core`.

/-- True iff the extern-backed `clmul` agrees with `pureClmul` on the
first `n` pairs `(a, b)` produced by `stepLCG` starting from `s`.
Each pair consumes two consecutive draws so that `a` and `b` are
independent within the stream. -/

/-- Discriminator self-test: replace `clmul` with a deliberately flipped
reference whose low word is XORed with `1`, and confirm that the same
stream rejects it. Without this guard, `streamAgrees` returning `true`
on the production stream would not by itself prove the loop ever
performs a meaningful comparison. -/
