# `SPEC/hex-gf2.md` requires that tests exercise each compiled wrapper
# path. A build selects its path with preprocessor guards, so one build runs
# exactly one of them: the Lake target passes only `-O3`, which means ordinary
# builds compile the portable fallback and never the intrinsic. This script
# compiles the self-test a second time with the flags that enable an intrinsic,
# so both paths are checked on every CI run rather than each machine silently
# testing whichever one it happens to select.
#
# Extends the repository's single CI job rather than adding a runner; it is a
# few seconds of `cc`.
